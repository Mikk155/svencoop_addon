Used for the combine weapons too. this energy ball will work the same as HL2. 

a bouncy proyectile that will have a life time limit of 15 seconds. if it bounce in a player. the player get push far away, if it bounce in something that has not suit (anything else) it does a instakill ALWAYS_GIB.

This entity can be hurt to increase his life time. i.e mapping want a trigger_hurt with negative value (heal) so this entity is into a box bouncing forever until the trigger_hurt is off or the entity get out the box.
